ABOUT
=====
Sparkweave is a solution for continuous pattern matching over RDF data streams.
It is based on the Rete algorithm, which allows efficient and truly continuous
processing of streamed data. Sparkweave leverages RDF schema information
associated to data streams to compute entailments, so that implicit knowledge is
taken into account for pattern matching. In addition, it supports time-based
sliding window to cope with the streaming nature of processed data.
